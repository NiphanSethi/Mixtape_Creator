# Mixtape Creator

## Table of Contents

## Project Overview

The application downloads a list of songs from YouTube to a new directory on your local machine. The list of songs must be stored in a text file, where each line in the file indicates the artist and the song name. This is passed as an input argument, along with the name of a new directory (the mixtape title) and its path. The application outputs this new directory containing the list of songs as mp3 files. Songs that failed to download are written to a separate text file entitled “Unsuccessful_Downloads.txt” in the directory itself. A GUI has been created to make these steps intuitive for users.
